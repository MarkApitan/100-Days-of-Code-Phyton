# Day 21: Build the Snake Game Part 2: Inheritance & List Slicing 

## Concept Learned
- Inheritance
- Slicing list and Tuples
- Got a better Idea on how to use OOP but still need more and more practice
- I can't do this program on my own yet because I haven't mastered OOP. I struggle to determine what should go into a class and what attributes it should have unless it's specified in the instructionss
